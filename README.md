# Predicting Shared Bike Usage in London

## Description

This is the repository for my London bike analysis, my final project for the capstone course of the HarvardX [*Data Science Professional Certificate*](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science) programme on [edX](https://www.edx.org/).

In this project, I use data science and machine learning techniques learned on the course to explore data and predict the demand for shared bikes in London. I welcome suggestions on how to improve the report or analysis.

## Files in the Repository

Included in the repository are the following:

1. The `.R` file used to produce figures and train models;

2. The `.Rmd` file used for writing the report;

3. The data set used for the analysis, `london_merged.csv`, stored within the `london_bikes` subfolder;

4. The finalized `.pdf` report.
